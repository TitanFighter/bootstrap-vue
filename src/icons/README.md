# Bootstrap Icons

> Bootstrap Icons are designed to work with Bootstrap components, from form controls to navigation.
> Bootstrap Icons are SVGs, so they scale quickly and easily and can be styled with CSS. While they
> are built for Bootstrap, they will work in any project.

BootstrapVue icon components are based on [`bootstrap-icons`](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/). Icons
are opt-in, meaning that they explicity need to be imported in order to be used. They are not installed
by default (except in the [browser build](/docs#build-variants)).
